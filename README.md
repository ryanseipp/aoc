# Advent of Code

My implementations of the Advent of Code challenges.
This is being used as a tool to learn and test different languages and techniques.

My goal is to complete all challenges in a number of different languages, unit test, and benchmark their performance.

Languages currently planned are:
 * Rust
 * Go
 * C
 * C++
 * C#
 * Haskell?
 * Typescript

### Completion
Challenge is completed and unit tested
