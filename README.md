# Advent of Code

My implementations of the Advent of Code challenges.
This is being used as a tool to learn and test different languages and techniques.

My goal is to complete all challenges in a number of different languages, unit test, and benchmark their performance.

Languages currently planned are:
 * Rust
 * Go
 * C
 * C++
 * C#
 * Haskell?
 * Typescript

### Completion
Challenge is completed and unit tested

### Benchmarks
All benchmarks run on an AMD Ryzen 7 2700X (8C 16T) with 32 GB RAM, over a 30 second measurement time.

Results are in the format: parse_time / part1_time / part2_time
